### About Me
Four year ago I wanted to work in EPAM. I studied CSS, HTML, JS myself on the FeeCodeCamp, but my English level was A2. 
Then I worked in the small company, where I learned React+Redux and React Native myself and created app for cargo transportation in React Native. 
After this experience I had to take a break due to the birth of my lovely children. 
In this time I improved my English skills and I was able to pass the IELTS for B1 level.
All time I was dreaming to work in EPAM, where I can creat amazing applications, because I like find solutions to various problems. 
Also in this company I would develop different hard and skills, such as  communication, team work and learn new technologies.
I like create complex and useful application, because it can help many people.
